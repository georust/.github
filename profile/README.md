# Georust
## An ecosystem of geospatial tools and libraries written in Rust

🗺️ Georust is a collective of [people](https://github.com/orgs/georust/people) who work on and maintain Rust crates related to geospatial computing, broadly defined. A non-exhaustive list of crates is listed on georust.org, with most development happening here on Github.

👋 We're active on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Fp2aape): please come and say hello, and ask questions.

📗 A [book](https://book.georust.org/) is (slowly) in development.
